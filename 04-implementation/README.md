# Implementation

This part includes the implementation of the library management system. In order to execute the application you will need to have the following installed:
1. Java 17
2. Maven


# Running the Application	
1. Clone the project   
   ![file structure](img/file structure.png)
2. Click file to go to directory 04-implementation, the construction should be show like this   
   ![open](img/open.png)   
   ![construction](img/construction.png)
3. Click database on the right to add a mysql Datasource   
   ![d](img/d.png)
4. Enter the mysql username and password   
   ![enter db pwd](img/dbPwd.png)
5. Click Apply
6. Right-click on the new Datasource and create a new schema called library   
   ![img](img/img.png)  
   
   ![new schema](img/newSchema.png)
7. Change the username and password in application.yaml   
   ![edit yaml](img/editYaml.png)
8. Run DemoApplication   
   ![start](img/start.png)
9. Copy the password in command line   
   ![generate pwd](img/SprintPwd.png)
10. Open a browser and type localhost:8080. Enter the landing page   
   ![enter pwd](img/enterPwd.png)
11. By default, the username is user and the password is the one you just copied   
12. Go to the home page and click Init Database Here   
   ![init](img/init.png)
13. Test function

### Reflection Statements
| Team Member | Contribution Reflection Statement |
|-------------|-------------------|
|TM1| In the 04 implementation part, I am involved in all the development component in terms of model implementation, repository implementation, some methods' implementation in  libraray system and the front-end and backend integration. I am mainly in charge of the library service implementation and the frontEnd design. |
|TM2| In the 04 implementation section, I participated in all development components, including most of the model implementation and repository implementation, some methods in the system, service, and  integration between front-end and back-end. I'm mainly responsible for the libaray system implementation and database relasionship maintain. |
|TM3| In the 04 implementation part, Iâ€™m involved in all the development component, especially in model implementation, Library Service implementation and System implementation and I partly participated in Repositories implementation, front-end and back-end integration and warehouse implementation. |
|TM4| In the 04 implementation section, I participated in all development components, including implementation of models and Repositories, implementation of some methods in the repository system, and front-end and back-end integration. I'm mainly responsible for the warehouse implementation and the FrontEnd page |
